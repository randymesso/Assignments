#Class: Game
##Data members: Players, NumOfDecks, Bet. These Data members are responsible for keeping track of the number of players in the game, the number of decks in the game, and the current bet
that is taking place. Methods: Print, Deal, AcceptBets, Push. These methods are able to print the current status of the game to the console, deal the cards out to the players,
accept bets as to what players want to risk(in this case always 100), or to call the game a tie with push.
#Class: Player
##Data members: Bank, Name, State: These keep track of how much money the player has left, the names of the players, and a variable keeping track of what numerical value their cards 
have. Methods: Bet, Win, Hit, DoubleDown, Stand, Quit. These methods allow wichever player is playing to go through the common functions of the game. 
#Class: Dealer
##Data members: Same as player plus "Hand". This keeps track of the current hand that is automatically given to the deal with the first two cards. Methods: same as player plus
"shuffle" this allows the dealer to shuffle the cards as well when the game is going. 
#Class Bank
##Data members: Amount. This keeps track of how much money each player has in the bank at a given time. Methods: Deposit, Withdrawl. These allow the given player or dealer to add
or takeaway money so they can bet from their bank.
#Class Hand
##Data Members: Size, Remaining. These keep track of how many cards are in the deck and how many are remaining in the user's hand at the time. Methods: Shuffle, sort, discard. 
These allow the hand class to perform common tasks that are needed to help the game contiue fluidly
#Class Card
##Data Members: Rank, Name, Value, Suit. These allow the program and user to know which card is being talked about at the given moment and to keep track of it. Methods: SetRank, 
SetValue, GetRank, GetCalue, Print. These methods help the user keep track of their cards and can even be used to manipulate them. For example these would allow you to change a 
ace from being worth 11 to 1. 
#Class Deck
##Data Members: Size, Remaining. This just tells us what the starting size of the deck was and how many cards are left after playing however long. Methods: Deal, shuffle, Reset. 
These allow the deck to be shuffled, dealt, and even reset to the way that it was to start. 

#How they work together: 
##Without the game, there is no instance of player(allowed 1 or more) or dealer(just one). The dealer inherits from bank and player and player inherits from bank. Looking at
both the dealer and the player, each of them only have one bank. Without the player, there is no hand. The player only has one hand at a time. That's when we get to the card 
class. This can exist seperately from the hand or the deck and can have zero or more instances.

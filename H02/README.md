## Definitions

#### Abstraction
> Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user

#### Attribute/properties
> Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. A property is a special sort of class member function between a data member and a method.
#### Class  
> A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

#### Class variable
> A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.
#### Composition
> It describes a class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables. This allows you to model a has-a association between objects

#### Encapsulation
> Refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit
#### Friends
> Is a function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data. A friend function is declared by the class that is granting access, so friend functions are part of the class interface, like methods.
#### Inheritance
> The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.
#### Instance Variable
> A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.
#### Member Variable
> is a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods (member functions)
#### Method
> A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition
#### Multiple Inheritance
> A feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class

#### Object
>  A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.
#### Overloading
> The reuse of the same symbol or function name for two or more distinct operations or functions

#### Polymorphism
> Refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.

#### Public / Private / Protected
> This allows the accessed object to be changed more easily without affecting objects that refer to it. Broadly speaking, public means everyone is allowed to access, private means that only members of the same class are allowed to access, and protected means that members of subclasses are also allowed
#### Virtual
> An inheritable and overridable function or method for which dynamic dispatch is facilitated
